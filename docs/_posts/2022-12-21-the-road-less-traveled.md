## Root Node: the Fork..

The brain; an organ which we believe is made up of a connected **network** of neurons that transmits information through electrochemical signals via synapses. As one of the most efficient and effective information processing systems known to humans, it is no surprise that we have been trying to replicate this in our machines. The so-called *Artificial Brain* or, more generally, *Artificial Intelligence* is a dream being pursued for decades by many.

A critical development in this area was the *Perceptron* model in the 50s, a simple model of a neuron defined as a linear function of its inputs, activated by a Heaviside step function. Extending this model into a directed network of neurons, namely into a multi-layered perceptron model, and with the rapid advance of computing power with GPGPUs in the 2000s and 2010s, we saw the rise of the **Deep Learning** era.

How do you represent that notion of an *artificial neural network* made up of **directed**, **compositions** of **linear functions** and **activation functions**? More specifically, into a framework for developing and training deep learning models?

It's natural to think of a **graph** as a apt representation of this. A graph is a set of nodes and edges, and

less traveled not only in the sense that it is less used, but also literally a shorter path.

Life is full of branches, and sometimes its hard to see which of the many paths to take. The poem masquerades as a meditation about choice, but the critic William Pritchard suggests that the speaker is admitting that “choosing one rather than the other was a matter of impulse, impossible to speak about any more clearly than to say that the road taken had ‘perhaps the better claim.’” In many ways, the poem becomes about how—through retroactive narrative—the poet turns something as irrational as an “impulse” into a triumphant, intentional decision. Decisions are nobler than whims, and this reframing is comforting, too, for the way it suggests that a life unfolds through conscious design. However, as the poem reveals, that design arises out of constructed narratives, not dramatic actions. 

These decisions, albeit impluses, are the conscious choice that creates a 'difference' whether that be good or bad. We try and wrap our decisions with a logical narrative, but in reality, aren't we just making it up as we go along? There isn't a single correct answer, and we might never know if we ever made the 'right' choice, but we can always follow what we perhaps think has the 'better claim'. 

Personally, the declartive, compiled approach to deep learning aligns with my understanding of the subject, and appeals to my sense of aesthetics. I'm not sure if it is the 'right' choice, but it is the one I am taking.
